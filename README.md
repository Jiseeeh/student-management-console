# STUDENT MANAGEMENT IN CONSOLE

## STEPS TO GET STARTED
- You can download the jar file at `out/artifacts/StudentManagementConsole.jar` 
then run this on your terminal. **(Make sure you have java installed)**

```java
java StudentManagementConsole.jar
```

- OR **clone the repository** and then run `Main.java`

```git 
git clone https://github.com/Jiseeeh/StudentManagementConsole.git
```

### After running
- Login using the **admin** and then create accounts there.
- `username: admin`
- `password: admin`

---

# What this console app can do
- Create **students** or **teachers** using the admin account or manually adding in the CSV file that will be generated.
- Give **Feedbacks and Tasks** as a Teacher to your Students. ***(That will be stored into a CSV file)***
- See your **Feedbacks and Tasks** as a Student.
- And other minor things.
